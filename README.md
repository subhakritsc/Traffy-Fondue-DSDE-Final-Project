# üß† Traffy Fondue DSDE Final Project

## Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes urban problems reported in **Bangkok Metropolitan Area** using the **Traffy Fondue** dataset. The dashboard displays issues through **maps, graphs, tables**, and **detailed problem comments**.

### üîç Analysis Concept

Our core idea is to **cluster problems** based on their **location** and **type**, enabling better tracking and evaluation of recurring issues.

### üìå Problem Definition

A "new problem occurrence" is defined as:

- A **new report** of the same **problem type** at the same **location**,  
- **After** the original problem has been marked as **resolved**.

> üîÅ Multiple reports **before** the issue is resolved are counted as **one** problem, to prevent duplication from citizen follow-ups.
